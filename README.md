**Airbnb**

[DCP9](src/com/piyush/dcp/airbnb/DCP9.java) - Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.

**Amazon**

[DCP12](src/com/piyush/dcp/amazon/DCP12.java) - There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters. 

[DCP13](src/com/piyush/dcp/amazon/DCP13.java) - Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.

**Facebook**

[DCP79](src/com/piyush/dcp/facebook/DCP79.java) - Given an array of integers, write a function to determine whether the array could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.

[DCP182](src/com/piyush/dcp/facebook/DCP182.java) - Given an undirected graph, check if the graph is minimally-connected.

[DCP338](src/com/piyush/dcp/facebook/DCP338.java) - Given an integer n, find the next biggest integer with the same number of 1-bits on.

**Google**

[DCP1](src/com/piyush/dcp/google/DCP1.java) - Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

[DCP3](src/com/piyush/dcp/google/DCP3.java) - Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.

[DCP78](src/com/piyush/dcp/google/DCP78.java) - Given k sorted singly linked lists, write a function to merge all the lists into one sorted singly linked list.

[DCP8](src/com/piyush/dcp/google/DCP8.java) - Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.

[DCP80](src/com/piyush/dcp/google/DCP80.java) - Given the root of a binary tree, return a deepest node.

[DCP61](src/com/piyush/dcp/google/DCP61.java) - Implement integer exponentiation. That is, implement the pow(x, y) function, where x and y are integers and returns x^y.

[DCP94](src/com/piyush/dcp/google/DCP94.java) - Given a binary tree of integers, find the maximum path sum between two nodes. 

**LinkedIn**

[DCP357](src/com/piyush/dcp/linkedin/DCP357.java) - You are given a binary tree in a peculiar string representation. Each node is written in the form (lr), where l corresponds to the left child and r corresponds to the right child. Given this representation, determine the depth of the tree.

**Microsoft** 

[DCP75](src/com/piyush/dcp/microsoft/DCP75.java) - Given an array of numbers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array.

**Samsung**

[DCP299](src/com/piyush/dcp/samsung/DCP299.java) - Given an undirected graph of pipe connections, return the lowest cost configuration of pipes such that each house has access to water. 

**Square**

[DCP162](src/com/piyush/dcp/square/DCP162.java) - Given a list of words, return the shortest unique prefix of each word.

**Stripe**

[DCP4](src/com/piyush/dcp/stripe/DCP4.java) - Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

**Twitter**

[DCP11](src/com/piyush/dcp/twitter/DCP11.java) - Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.

[DCP292](src/com/piyush/dcp/twitter/DCP292.java) - Given an adjacency list of students and their enemies, write an algorithm that finds a satisfactory pair of teams, or returns False if none exists.

**Uber**

[DCP2](src/com/piyush/dcp/uber/DCP2.java) - Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

[DCP293](src/com/piyush/dcp/uber/DCP293.java) - Pyramid form (increasing then decreasing) consecutive array using reduce operations. 

**Yext**

[DCP284](src/com/piyush/dcp/yext/DCP284.java) - Given a binary tree and a particular node, find all cousins of that node.
