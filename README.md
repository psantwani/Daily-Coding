`[DCP12] - There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.` 

`[DCP13] - Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.`
